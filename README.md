# Drupal Sublime Text

Add Drupal snippets/functionality

## Install

Mac OS X:

	pushd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    git clone git://github.com/robballou/drupal-sublimetext.git Drupal
    popd

## Usage

Most of this package adds snippets for Drupal core functions. I am
still working on adding/checking that these functions are created
correctly, but most of the functions should be there. There is also
some information about [snippets in the Sublime documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html).

There also are some other completions for constants. There still needs
to be a big import for some constants here but for now this should help
if you use these in your site development.
